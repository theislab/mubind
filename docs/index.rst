Mubind - Learning sequence associations with single-cell transitions
================================================

`mubind` (short for ***multibind***) is a neural network architecture learn sequence associations with genomics data reaoduts, while using full graph representations as sparse graphs. The model architecture is scalable, and designed to analysis of both single-cell as well as bulk genomics data.
