Mubind - Learning sequence associations with single-cell transitions
================================================

`mubind` (short for ***multibind***) is a neural network architecture designed to learn sequence associations with genomics data through the leveraging of sample-sample relationships as sparse graphs. The model architecture is suitable for the analysis of both single-cell as well as bulk genomics data.
