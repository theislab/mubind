  abstract = {Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells (https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy). Along with Scanpy, we present AnnData, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices (https://github.com/theislab/anndata).},

  abstract = "The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is a brain region in which
              neurogenesis persists into adulthood; however, the relationship
              between developmental and adult dentate gyrus neurogenesis has
              not been examined in detail. Here we used single-cell RNA
              sequencing to reveal the molecular dynamics and diversity of
              dentate gyrus cell types in perinatal, juvenile, and adult mice.
              We found distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell
              types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast
              stages and fully mature granule cells. We observed shifts in the
              molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia and
              granule cells during the postnatal period that were then
              maintained through adult stages. In contrast, intermediate
              progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature granule cells were
              nearly indistinguishable at all ages. These findings demonstrate
              the fundamental similarity of postnatal and adult neurogenesis in
              the hippocampus and pinpoint the early postnatal transformation
              of radial glia from embryonic progenitors to adult quiescent stem

              Here, to systematically map the regulatory landscape of neural
              differentiation in the mouse neocortex, we profiled gene
              expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells and
              integrated these data with measurements of enhancer activity, DNA
              methylation and three-dimensional genome architecture in purified
              cell populations. This allowed us to identify thousands of new
              enhancers, their predicted target genes and the temporal
              relationships between enhancer activation, epigenome remodeling
              and gene expression. We characterize specific neuronal
              transcription factors associated with extensive and frequently
              coordinated changes across multiple epigenetic modalities. In
              addition, we functionally demonstrate a new role for Neurog2 in
              directly mediating enhancer activity, DNA demethylation,
              increasing chromatin accessibility and facilitating chromatin
              looping in vivo. Our work provides a global view of the gene

  abstract = "Single-cell genomics technologies enable multimodal profiling of
              millions of cells across temporal and spatial dimensions.
              Experimental limitations prevent the measurement of
              all-encompassing cellular states in their native temporal
              dynamics or spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport theory has
              emerged as a powerful tool to overcome such constraints, enabling
              the recovery of the original cellular context. However, most
              algorithmic implementations currently available have not kept up
              the pace with increasing dataset complexity, so that current
              methods are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale
              to single-cell atlases. Here, we introduce multi-omics
              single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a general and scalable
              framework for optimal transport applications in single-cell
              genomics, supporting multimodality across all applications. We
              demonstrate moscot's ability to efficiently reconstruct
              developmental trajectories of 1.7 million cells of mouse embryos
              across 20 time points and identify driver genes for first heart
              field formation. The moscot formulation can be used to transport
              cells across spatial dimensions as well: To demonstrate this, we
              enrich spatial transcriptomics datasets by mapping multimodal
              information from single-cell profiles in a mouse liver sample,
              and align multiple coronal sections of the mouse brain. We then
              present moscot.spatiotemporal, a new approach that leverages gene
              expression across spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover the
              spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse embryogenesis. Finally, we
              disentangle lineage relationships in a novel murine,
              time-resolved pancreas development dataset using paired
              measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility,
              finding evidence for a shared ancestry between delta and epsilon
              cells. Moscot is available as an easy-to-use, open-source python
