# No Read Left Behind (NRLB)

This repository contains code for building and using accurate biophysical models for protein-DNA interaction. More information can be found in the following paper: Rastogi C, et al. (2018) Accurate and sensitive quantification of protein-DNA binding affinity. PNAS 115(16):E3692-E3701 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29610332).

There are two distinct components to this repository:

* ModelFitting : commandline tools for building NRLB models (mostly intended for experts)
* R-package/NRLBtools : user-friendly R package that contains all models discussed in Rastogi et al. (2018)
